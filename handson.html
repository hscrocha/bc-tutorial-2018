## Exercises: Hands-on Beginner to Solidity

In this section, I will present some hands-on coding exercises for coding smart contracts in Solidity. I will also explain some of the basic concepts of the Solidity language before each exercise.

Consult the [Solidity Documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for a more in dept language description.

### Starting out

#### What is Solidity

Solidity is high-level language to code smart contracts in the Ehtereum platform. Solidity is a statically typed language inspired by C++, Javascript, and Python. It supports multiple inheritance, user defined types (e.g., structs, enums), and it even has some "syntactic suggar" for other features.
