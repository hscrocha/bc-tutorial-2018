# Exercises: Hands-on Beginner to Solidity

In this section, I will present some hands-on coding exercises for coding smart contracts in Solidity. I will also explain some of the basic concepts of the Solidity language before each exercise.

## 1. Starting out

### 1.1. What is Solidity

Solidity is high-level language to code smart contracts in the Ehtereum platform. Solidity is a statically typed language inspired by C++, Javascript, and Python. It supports multiple inheritance, user defined types (e.g., structs, enums), and it even has some "syntactic suggar" for other features. Please, consult the [Solidity Documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for a more in depth language description.

### 1.2. Remix

[Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) is an IDE for Solidity. It can run directly on your web-browser without the need to download or install anything. Remix uses the latest Javascript compiler for Solidity. One of the best features of Solidity is that it runs on a simulator enviroment by default. Therefore, we can play with contract code without having to connect to the Ethereum blockchain (which we need to pay for most of its operations).

All the exercises in this section use Remix. Therefore, you should open and get acquainted with it. The figure bellow shows the Remix interface.

At the left part of the screen, we can see "browser" and "config". Browser will show all contracts that you have created in Remix. Config is used for special setup and I will not use that. At the very top on the left part, we can see some small icons. The most important one (and the only we are going to need) is the first icon that looks like a plus sign. That icon creates a new contract.

The middle part of the screen is the code editor. The lower part of the middle screen is the transactions log. Every operation on the blockchain creates a transaction. Remix will show on this log every transaction that it created. 

Now, I recommend paying special attention to the right part, here is where most of our interactions with the smart contracts will happen. There are 6 tabs on the right part, but for this tutorial we only need the first two: "compile" and "run". Compile is useful to verify the errors and warnings on your code, use this tab if you are having a hard time fixing your code. The Run tab is where the "magic" is, so lets focus on it.

* The enviroment combobox for this tutorial should be JavaScript VM. That is a simulation of an Ethereum blockchain. The other enviroment options allow to actually connect to Ethereum. 
* The accounts will have some pre-generated user accounts, each with 100 Ether on it (on the JavaScript VM enviroment). We will need accounts to deploy and interact with contracts. The selected account in this comboox will be the one that is "executing" the operations. 
* The gas limit is how much gas we are sending when we execute the next transaction. For more information on gas check [this](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html?limit#gas).
* Value is how much cryptocurrency the selected account will send when we execute the next transaction. The usually unit is Wei (1 Ether = 10^18 Wei ), but we can change the unit on the left combobox of value.
* The next combobox will have the available contracts on this source code that compile without errors. 
* The deploy bottom will deploy one instance of the selected contract (on the above combobox).
* The next textfield is used to load a contract instance that was previously deployed. The specified address will be "type-casted" as the selected contract on the above combobox.
* The next panel shows the transactions recorded for this contract. This differs from the transaction log at the bottom that shows transaction from every contract.
* The final panel is where your deployed contracts will be. Clicking on the deployed contract instance will open the options to call its functions (and that is how we interact with contracts).

Understanding the Remix IDE is important to execute the tutorial examples. Please come back here and read it again if you are struggling to execute something (most of the time is just a matter is selecting the right thing in one combobox at the Run tab).

### 1.3. My First Contract

Lets start by creating our first smart contract in Solidity. I am a firm believer in "learn by doing it". Remember to use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to deploy the contract and execute its functions.

A contract is very similar to a class in a object-oriented programming. It contains attributes, functions, and etc. Lets jump into the code to our first contract (ignore the warnings for now).

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;
/**
 * @title My First Contract
 * @author Henrique
 */
contract MyFirstContract {
    string name;
    
    function setName(string _name){
        name = _name;
    }
    
    function getName() returns (string) {
        return name;
    }
}
```

The first line `pragma solidity^0.4.24;` indicates which version of Solidity we are using (I am using the most current version at the time I wrote this tutorial). Since the Solidity language is still under development, a lot can change between even minor versions releases. Therefore, specifying the version makes the compiler aware of which version to use. 

Comments in Solidity are like C++ and Javascript (and many others). However, if a you start a multi-line with an extra asterisk (`/**`) or a single line comment with an extra slash (`///`), then you are indicating that this comment will have tags to complement the information of the definition (similar to a JavaDoc). In my example (lines 2-5), I am using a tag to indicate the title of a contract a another to indicate its author.

Every contract is created by using the `contract` keyword. As I previously said, it can contain attributes, functions, and other elements. In this contract, I created one attribute called 'name' and two functions. For now you can ignore the warning on the functions (I will came back to fix these warnings latter). To deploy the contract select its name on the right part and click on the deploy button. An instance should appear on the right, click on its name to "open" its options so that we can execute its functions.

You should note that the select account now has 99.99... Ether instead of the initial 100. This is because every transaction needs to pay a cost (usually defined by gas amount and price). Deploying a contract is a transaction, and as such it also has a cost attached to it. You can also see that deploying a contract created a transaction in the log.

You can now have fun and execute the contract's functions. See how every function call creates a transaction. In the transaction log you can also see the details of transaction (e.g., how gas it spent, its parameters).

Congratulations, you just finished your first contract and interaction with the blockchain.

## 2. Basic Concepts

### 2.1. Primitive Types

The primitive types available in Solidity are the following:
* __bool__ - 1 byte boolean.
* __int__ - 32 bytes integer that accepts positive and negative values.
  * __int8 / int16 / ... int256__ - you customize the integer storage size (in increments of 8 bits) up to 256 bits.
* __uint__ - 32 bytes integer that accepts only non-negative values (i.e., unsigned integer).
  * __uint8 / uint16 / ... uint256__ - similar to int, it is possible to customize its storage size (in increments of 8 bits) up to 256 bits.
* __byte__ - 1 byte.
  * __bytes1 / bytes2 / ... bytes32__ - syntactic suggar for a byte array (up to 32 bytes).
* __fixed__ - fixed point numbers (i.e., real numbers). The storage for the integer and fractional part is flexible, and we can specify its place. Fixed is actually an alias for fixed128x18 (see bellow).
  * __fixed0x8 / fixed0x16 / ... fixed0x256 / ... fixed8x8 ...__ - fixed point number where the first number specifies the number of bits used for the integer part (i.e., before the decimal separator), and the other number specifies the bits for the fractional part. The numbers used must be in increments of 8 (zero is allowed). Moreover, the total amount of bits from both parts must be lower or equal than 256 bits. 
  * __CAUTION:__ fixed numbers are not fully supported in this version of Solidity, avoid using them.
* __ufixed__ - unsigned fixed point number. Besides not allowing negative values, it has the same characteristics as fixed.
  * __ufixed0x8 / ufixed 0x16 / ... ufixed0x256 / ...ufixed8x8 ...__ - it is also possible to customize the storage of ufixed's integer and fractional parts. Same restrictions as fixed applies here as well.
  * __CAUTION:__ fixed numbers (even the unsigned version) are not fully supported in this version of Solidity, avoid using them.
* __string__ - dynamically-sized UTF-8 encoded string.
* __address__ - a 20 bytes type that represents an Ethereum address. _This is very important, because it is very common to handle address when coding a smart contract_. An address references either an account or a contract. Every address have the attribute "balance" which shows how many Ether (stored in Wei) that address have. Addresses also have special functions that will talk later. 

The reason for many types to have the option to customize its storage is "cost". Storage and execution in the Ethereum blockchain have transactional costs attached to them. Therefore, optimizing your contract to use less storage when possible will reduce its overall costs for you and its users.
