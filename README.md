## Under construction.

Please wait until my presentation at CBSoft (September 17) to access this page and materials. I am still editing and trying to improve its contents.

## Introduction

Blockchain has become very popular recently due to the general adoption of cryptocurrencies. Nowadays, cryptocurrencies like BitCoin and Ether are common enough to be recognized by most people. Even though blockchain technology is mostly recognized for its cryptocurrencies, a very important and prominent application of blockchain is the execution of Smart Contracts. The term blockchain-oriented software (BOS) defines applications that interact with blockchain, usually by using a smart contract. The popularity and rapid growth of BOS are creating problems that fall within the scope of Software Engineering. 

In this context, a new research topic has been discovered: Blockchain-oriented Software Engineering (BOSE); as we need novel and specialized software engineering practices to handle blockchain applications. The first part of the tutorial is a presentation (at CBSoft 2018) to provide a background knowledge of Blockchain and Smart Contracts so that researchers may understand better this new technology, its pitfalls, and opportunities. The second part is devoted to hands-on exercises and tools to interact with blockchain. This tutorial is supposed to be understandable even if a person has almost no previous knowledge on this topic.

In this page you can find the materials for the tutorial including slides, lessons, code, and etc.

### About me.

I am Henrique Rocha, a Post-Doctoral researcher in Inria Lille (2017-2019). My current research is devoted to blockchain-oriented software engineering. I contributed to many open source blockchain tools from my blockchain research group at Inria (https://github.com/RMODINRIA-Blockchain). I did my Ph.D. at UFMG in the ASERG group. I also has experience as a college lecturer in private Brazilian institutions.
